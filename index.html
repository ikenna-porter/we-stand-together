                        <h3>professional career</h3>
                        <p>
                            I started my professional career working as a budget analyst in Washington DC after I
                            received my bachelor’s degree in Economics from the University of Virginia. Since this job
                            was in a
                            university, I worked alongside several professors who were truly passionate about teaching.
                            I was so inspired by them that I started reading about the philosophy of education, which
                            led
                            me to Paulo Freire’s book “Pedagogy of the Oppressed.” This book was so convincing that it
                            drastically changed my outlook on life and inspired me to become a teacher, which is my
                            current
                            profession.

                        <p>It wasn’t until the COVID lockdown, during which I had ample free time, that I dabbled in
                            programming. I remember the excitement I felt from challenging myself to solve problems and
                            think in different ways. For the first time since college it felt like I was growing
                            intellectually, thereby becoming a better version of myself. The satisfaction that I felt in
                            myself from learning this new skill is what ultimately convinced me to change careers.

                                    Since beginning this journey, I have taught myself concepts such as form creation and
                                    validation in HTML, flexbox and the grid layout in CSS and higher order functions,
                                    closures and recursion in
                                    Javascript. I have also started studying algorithms and data structures in order to
                                    write code
                                    more efficiently.

                                    While I am proud of coming this far, I know that I have a lot more to learn, which is
                                    why I want to
                                    catapult my learning with Hack Reactor.
